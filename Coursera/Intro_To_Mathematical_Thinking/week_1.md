# Week 1

It's about thinking, not learning new math techniques

Learn to stop looking for formulas or procedures to follow
You have to look at what the problem says

It's about understanding, not doing 

## Background Reading: What is Mathematics? 

1. More than arithmetic.
  - Most math used in modern science and engineering is no more than 400 years
    old
  - The typical high school math curriculum is at least 300 years old, or even
    two-thousand years old
  - Math began with the invention of numbers around 10,000 years ago (for use
    with money)
  - Math was very utilitarian up until the Greeks in 500BCE, who made it an area
    of study
  - Euclid's Elements is the most widely circulated book after the Bible
  - Since Algebra, there have only been two further advances, calculus and
    probability theory
  - Arithmetic and Number Theory study the patterns of numbers and counting
  - Geometry studies the patterns of shape
  - Calculus allows us to handle the patterns of motion
  - Logic studies the patterns of reasoning
  - Probability Theory studies the patterns of chance
  - Topology studies the patterns of closeness and position
  - Fractal Geometry studies the self-similarity found in the natural world

2. Mathematical Notation
  - The mathematical reliance on abstract notation is a reflection of the
    abstract nature of the patterns they study.
  - Different aspects of reality require different forms of description
  - The commutative law of addition could be written in English as: When two
    numbers are added, their order is not important.
  - The same law can be expressed in symbolic form as: m + n = n + m
  - Symbolic notation in it's modern form is credited to Francois Viete in the
    16th century.

3. Modern College-level Mathematics
  - High school level math is primarily about calculation, whereas higher level
    math is about understanding through mathematics itself
  - Dirichlet created the conception of a function as a rule that produces new
    numbers from old, rather than producing a new number y from any given number x
  - A function can be any rule that takes objects of one kind and produces new
    objects from them
  - Mathematics began to study abstract functions, those not specified by a
    formula but by their behavior
  - The higher level of Math was attempted to be taught in high school in the
    1960s, as 'New Math', but failed

4. Why are you having to learn this stuff? 
  - Education is not solely about the acquisition of specific tools to be used
    in a subsequent career. Education is preparation for life, and only part of
    that is the mastery of specific work skills.
  - The world needs more people who can take a new problem and describe key
    features of the problem mathematically, and use that mathematical
    description to analyze the problem in precise fashion.

## Lecture 1 - Intro Material 

Math is the Science of Patterns 

Banach-Tarski Paradox: In theory, a sphere can be cut up in such a way that you
can reassemble it form two identical spheres, each the same size as the original
one.

The secret to this course is reflection and engagement, not completion
Real math takes time 

### Getting Precise About How We Use Language 

- One American dies of melanoma almost every hour 
  vs 
- Almost every hour, an American dies of melanoma

The first sentence, when read literally, makes an absurd claim.
When mathematicians use language, the rely on the literal meaning

The primary means to determine the truth of a claim in mathematics are Proofs

Prime Numbers: N = (p1 x p2 x p3 x ... pn) + 1

Mathematical language requires the elimination of as much linguistic ambiguity
as possible

### Four Linguistic Forms of Mathematics

- Object a has property P
- Every object of type T has property P
- There is an object of type T having property P
- If statement A, then statement B

### Key terms of Mathematical language

- and 
- or
- not
- implies 
- for all
- there exists 


## Lecture 2 - Logical Combinators 

The only way to acquire a new way of thinking, is to try multiple different ways

### AND

And is a conjunction of two conjuncts. 
If both conjuncts are true, then the conjunction is true. 
If any are false, the conjunction is false

In math, conjunction is communicative.
In everyday English, the word AND is not always communicative


### OR

OR is ambiguous, it can either be exclusive or inclusive 

Inclusive OR is called a disjunction
If one of the disjuncts is true, then the disjunction is true 

### NOT

Not is the negation of a statement
Negating a word in a sentence is not the same as negating a sentence
