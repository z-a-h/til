# Object Assign  

Use to copy values from one or more objects to a target object.
The method takes at least two parameters. The first is the target object and the second (or more) are the source objects for the properties to assign to the target.

Properties with the same key are overwritten and later sources overwrite the properties of earlier sources.

To create a new object rather than mutating the target, provide an empty object for the target parameter and then the object to change properties on as the second parameter.
