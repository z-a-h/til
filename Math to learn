Conjugation of j?

Sinusoidal functions (sine wave)
--------------------------------
- Mathematical curve that describes a smooth repetitive oscillation


Complex Numbers
--------------------------------
- Numbers that are build with two parts, a real and imaginary part
- imaginary numbers are the square root of -1
- Complex numbers are represented in the complex plane, where the real number is plotted on the x axis and the imaginary number on the y axis
Euler's Formula
- Unit circles show all complex numbers within a magnitude
- Complex numbers can be displayed in rectangular or polar form.
- Rectangular form is displayed as the intersection of the two values on the complex plane
- Polar forms represents the number as a vector

Euler's Formula
--------------------------------
- establishes a relationship between polar and rectangular forms of complex numbers


Complex Sinusoids
--------------------------------
- Sinusoids that are expressed using Euler's Formal
- The sum of two complex sine-waves can cancel the imaginary component of the sine-waves and produce a real sine-waves


Scalar (or dot) product of sequences
--------------------------------
- Takes two equal length sequences of numbers and returns a singular value
- Orthogonality of sequences: When two sequences are orthogonal, their scalar product is equal to zero
- The dot product is the project of one sequence into another

Even and odd functions
--------------------------------
- f[n] is even if f[-n] = f[n]
- f[n] is odd if f[-n] = f[-n]
- cosine is an even function because it is symmetric at 0
- sine is an odd function because it is asymmetric at 0

Convolution of sequences
--------------------------------
- mathematical operation of two sequences producing a third sequence that can be viewed as a modified version of one of the original sequences
