# PolkaDot 

Polkadot is a protocol for communicating and interacting with multiple block
chains. 

The protocol relies on two agents, Validators and Parachains

Parachains are nodes that connect to other networks/chains and creates
transaction blocks. 

Validators are agents who watch the blocks of the parachains and agree on the
ordering of the chains and transactions

It allows communication between chains that have forked or had differences in
protocols.
