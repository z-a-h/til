# Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions are unnamed functions. In elm anonymous functions are created by using a backslash
before the first parameter and using the arrow function to separate the body of the function

Here is an example of an anonymous function that adds to parameters together

```
\a b -> a + b
```
